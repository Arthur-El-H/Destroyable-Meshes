Object/Hammer (:IDestructor) hits Object/Wall(:IDestructible).

Force X is added at Collision. 
Force effects the IDestructible by

(manipulating the surface of the wall / 2D: )							
	a) creating a hole in the wall / a crack in wall(a crack is a series of connected Holes)
	b) expanding existing cracks in the wall.

	each of those actions reduces X, which cannot fall under 0

(manipulating the cracks inside of the wall 3D: )
	Every hole in the wall is the startpoint of a crack, that goes into the wall, a so-called crackInDepth.
	Those cracksInDepth can also be effected by a Force and can:

	a) Expand existing cracksInDepth

When expanding, cracks can:
	a.1) cross another crackInDepth
	a.2) expand to the other side of the wall

When a.1 or a.2 happens, it is possible that the cracks on the wall form a polygon which is fully disconnected from the wall.
This polygon is then "cutted out" of the wall by the Cutter and becomes a fragment.	

Grid2D and Grid3D help calculating the placing and expansion of cracks and holes.

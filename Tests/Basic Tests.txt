As this Project will be developed test-driven, in here ideas for 
tests / testable features are collected before Refining/Differentiation/ final implemenation:

- calculate Force
	Scan all surrounding cracks in specific distance from source of Force
	distance is dependent of strength of force. Only direct neighbours are returned:
	If there is no straight line from source of Force to a crack, which doesnt cross 
	any other crack, it is not returned.
		Hit --> List <Crack>

- Get Alignments from crack
	Given a Crack, the tested functions calculates the number of 
	different aligned parts and there respective alignments.
		Crack --> List <Crack, Vector3 alignment>

- Get possible expansion are
	Crack crack, Vector3 crackAlignment, float force, Vector3 sourceOfForce 
	--> area of possible expansion (4x Vector3 in 2D or 6x Vector3 in 3D)

- Expand Crack
	area of possible expansions (AopE) --> other crack to connect to (check in area larger AopE!) 
					       or an random point inside AopE.

Object/Hammer (:IDestructor) hits Object/Wall(:IDestructible).

Force X is added at Collision. 
Force effects the IDestructible by

a) breaking a part of the wall out of the wall.								//This describes the surface 2D calculations
b) creating a hole in the wall / a crack in wall(a crack is a series of connected Holes)
c) expanding existing cracks in the wall.

each of those actions reduces X, which cannot fall under 0.


'a)' is a special case of 'c)', because it means that the cracks in the wall form a polygon which is fully disconnected from the wall.
This polygon is then "cutted out" of the wall by the Cutter and becomes a fragment.

Grid2D and Grid3D help calculating the placing and expansion of cracks and holes.



Every hole in the wall is the startpoint of a crack, that goes into the wall, a so-called crackInDepth.
Those cracksInDepth can also be effected by a Force and can:

a) Expand
When expanding, they can:
	a.1) cross another crackInDepth
	a.2) expand to the other side of the wall
